# VHDL-case-statement-generator

An old code that was used to generate a bunch of case statements in VHDL using python that were simply too big or too many to write for hand. The code is very specific to one single project, but it can be edited and easily re-writable by changing a few variables and possibly re-writing the code a little to work for other projects as well.
